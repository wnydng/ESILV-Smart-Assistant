## Repository Overview

This repository contains all the materials for the **Smart Assistant** project, developed for the **LLM & GenAI Project**.

## Project Context

  This project focuses on developing an Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) system capable of
extracting structured information from scanned documents (invoices, forms, certificates, IDs,
etc.) using multimodal Large Language Models (VLMs) and OCR pipelines.
The goal is to go beyond pure text extraction by combining visual understanding (layout, tables,
signatures, stamps, etc.) with semantic reasoning using Generative AI.
The system should process batches of scanned documents and produce JSON outputs containing
the extracted information in a well-defined schema.
Students are expected to experiment with open-source OCR engines (such as DeepSeek OCR or
Dots OCR) and multimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA, Pixtral, or Llama 3.2 Vision) deployed locally
via Ollama or integrated through Hugging Face / GCP endpoints.
